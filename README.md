🛡️ TrustKYC
Reusable Digital Identity Token Mechanism — A Privacy-First Approach to KYC in India
🚀 About the Project

TrustKYC is an innovative, tokenised, consent-driven digital KYC framework designed for the Indian financial ecosystem. The solution allows a user to complete KYC only once and reuse a secure, encrypted digital identity token across multiple financial institutions through explicit consent and selective disclosure.

Unlike traditional KYC systems that require repeat verification and internet dependency, TrustKYC works even without internet access at the time of verification or payment using a secure identity wallet. This improves accessibility for low-network regions and enhances nationwide financial inclusion.

🧩 Problem Statement Alignment — Apix Hackathon (Theme: Tokenised KYC)

Financial institutions repeatedly request KYC information for onboarding and regulatory compliance, leading to:

User friction

High operational cost

Fragmented data storage

Increased identity risk

Slower financial inclusion

TrustKYC directly addresses these gaps by enabling reusable, cryptographically-signed identity tokens with full user control.

🔐 Core Features

✔ Tokenized Reusable KYC

✔ Selective Disclosure via Consent Layer

✔ Offline Wallet-Based Identity Sharing

✔ Audit Trail & Lifecycle Control

✔ Interoperability with Aadhaar-Offline, DigiLocker & CKYCR

✔ ZKP-Ready Privacy Architecture
